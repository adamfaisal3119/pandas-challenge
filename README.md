Summary of Analysis:

Performance by School Type:

Independent schools generally outperform government schools in terms of average math and reading scores as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall.
Griffin High School, Holden High School, and Pena High School, all independent schools, demonstrate higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing rates compared to Bailey High School and Rodriguez High School, government schools with similar or larger student populations.


Performance by School Size:



Smaller schools (with fewer than 1000 students) tend to have higher average math and reading scores and higher passing rates compared to medium and large-sized schools.
Holden High School, a small-sized school, outperforms other schools in terms of average math and reading scores as well as passing rates, despite having a smaller budget compared to larger schools like Bailey High School and Rodriguez High School.
Conclusions:


School Type Impact on Academic Performance:

The type of school (independent or government) appears to have a significant impact on academic performance. Independent schools consistently demonstrate higher average scores and passing rates compared to government schools.


School Size and Academic Achievement:

Smaller schools tend to outperform medium and large-sized schools in terms of academic achievement. This suggests that smaller class sizes and more personalized attention may contribute to better student outcomes.
These conclusions provide valuable insights into factors influencing academic performance and can inform decision-making processes related to school funding, resource allocation, and educational policies.
